# Jido Proof Inventory

Version: 2.0  
Last updated: 2026-07-23  
Positioning anchor: `Jido is the Elixir framework for long-running agent systems.` (`jido-e02`)
Primary inputs: `specs/positioning.md` §11 (Canon), `specs/audits/control-inventory-2026-07-23.md`

> **Refresh (2026-07-23):** Operations content is now published — incident playbooks, production-readiness checklist, and security-and-governance are live under `/docs/operations`. Retired `/training/*` modules are no longer proof assets; link to the Operations pages instead. See the Control Proof section for the operational-control claim fields (`jido-e02` T28/T44).

> **Purpose:** Map every positioning claim to concrete, verifiable proof. If a cell is empty, the claim is unsupported. Fill this in before publishing any major page.
>
> **Rule from positioning.md §8:** Every pillar must reference at least one package, one runnable example, and one training module.

## Summary Scorecard

| Pillar | Training modules | Runnable examples | Operational demos | Reference docs | Architecture diagrams |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Reliability | 🟡 2 partial | 🟡 1 exists, 1 missing | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 |
| 2 — Coordination | ✅ 3 exist | 🟡 1 exists, 2 missing | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 |
| 3 — Operations | 🟡 1 partial | 🟡 1 exists | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 |
| 4 — Composable | ✅ 2 exist | ❌ 0 purpose-built | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 |

**Honest assessment:** Training module briefs and ecosystem docs provide a foundation, but there are zero operational demos, zero purpose-built reference docs, and zero architecture diagrams. The proof is light across every pillar. Content plan briefs exist for most gaps — the work is converting briefs into finished assets.

## Priority TODO List

_Ranked by positioning impact × effort._

1. ❌ **Failure drill demo** (Pillar 1) — Single most impactful proof for reliability claim
2. ❌ **Signal routing multi-agent demo** (Pillar 2) — Proves coordination is real
3. ❌ **Dashboard instrumentation walkthrough** (Pillar 3) — Proves observability is real
4. ❌ **Package matrix** (Pillar 4) — Foundational reference for composability claim
5. ❌ **Minimal-stack quickstart** (Pillar 4) — Proves incremental adoption
6. ❌ **Why BEAM comparison** (Cross-cutting) — Unlocks Python/TS persona journeys
7. ❌ **Telemetry event catalog** (Pillar 3) — SRE persona table stakes
8. ❌ **Production runbook** (Pillar 1 + 3) — Operability proof
9. ❌ **Mixed-stack integration demo** (Cross-cutting) — Polyglot persona proof
10. ❌ **End-to-end tool-calling example** (Pillar 2) — AI product engineer entry point

_This document is a living inventory. Update status columns as assets are created. Every ❌ is a positioning claim without proof._

---

## Control Proof Fields (`jido-e02` T44)

Every operational-control claim records: package, version/configuration, the test or example that proves it, durability, and the limitation. Control proof does not use one concept (e.g., telemetry) as proof of another (e.g., audit).

| Control claim | Mechanism | Proof | Limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Supervised lifecycle | AgentServer + OTP supervision | `/docs/operations` production-readiness checklist; failure drill pending (runnable app) | Restart ≠ state recovery; persistence is application-supplied |
| Fail-closed authorization | `prepare_action/3` plugin hook | `/docs/operations/security-and-governance`; controlled-agent example pending | Not a built-in IAM/RBAC product |
| Causal history | durable Signal Journal adapter | `/docs/operations/security-and-governance`; restart test pending | Default is not durable; retention is application-defined |
| Correlated telemetry | `Jido.Observe`, optional `jido_otel` | `/docs/operations` observability items; OTel export is Experimental | Telemetry is not an audit log |
| Cost/quota control | `jido_ai` tool/effect/prompt/quota policies | AI operations guide pending; quota example pending | Application sets the budgets |

Claims in the "Proof" column marked "pending" require the long-running reference application (`specs/operations-reference-architecture.md`) before they become public proof.
